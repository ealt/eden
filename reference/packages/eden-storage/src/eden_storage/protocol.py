"""The ``Store`` Protocol — structural interface of a conforming EDEN store.

This module pins the task-side stores named in chapter 8
([`spec/v0/08-storage.md`](../../../../spec/v0/08-storage.md)) — task
store (§1), event log reads (§2.1 ``replay`` + ``read_range``), and
idea/variant persistence (§1.7) — as a single Python `Protocol`.
A deployment MAY split the physical layout any way it likes (§7);
the Protocol constrains the observable contract.

**Out of scope at Phase 6:**

- The artifact store (§5) is deferred to Phase 10 when blob storage
  lands alongside the Compose stack.
- The streaming ``subscribe`` operation (§2.1) is deferred to Phase 8
  when the cross-process wire protocol exposes it over a transport
  that can actually stream; Phase 6's in-process / SQLite backends
  implement the pull-based ``replay`` + ``read_range`` siblings
  instead.

Why a single Protocol and not three:

- Chapter 8 §7 explicitly permits a single backend to serve all three
  stores, and the transactional invariant (§6.1, composite commits)
  is most naturally expressed when a caller talks to *one* object that
  atomically applies state changes and their events together. Two
  separate objects with an external commit coordinator would add
  complexity with no normative benefit.
- Every composite commit in
  [`spec/v0/05-event-protocol.md`](../../../../spec/v0/05-event-protocol.md)
  §2.2 spans more than one store (task + idea, task + variant, task
  + variant, etc.); a Protocol that straddles those stores is the
  smallest surface that can express "these writes land together."

The Protocol is structural (`runtime_checkable=False`): a conforming
backend does not subclass it; matching the method signatures is
enough. Two reference backends satisfy it — ``InMemoryStore`` and
``SqliteStore`` — and conformance tests parametrize across both.

    Every method is an atomic operation under chapter 8 §6: the
    state change it describes, any composite effects
    (``05-event-protocol.md`` §2.2), and the event append(s) all
    land together or not at all.

    A conforming backend MUST raise the error types from
    [`errors.py`](errors.py) on rejection:

    - ``NotFound`` — referenced entity does not exist.
    - ``AlreadyExists`` — insert collided with an existing id.
    - ``IllegalTransition`` — state transition not in the machine.
    - ``WrongClaimant`` — submit's ``worker_id`` ≠ ``task.claim.worker_id``
      (atomic claim-match per
      [`spec/v0/04-task-protocol.md`](../../../../spec/v0/04-task-protocol.md)
      §4.1).
    - ``NotClaimed`` — submit against a task whose ``claim`` has been
      cleared (reclaim or terminal).
    - ``ConflictingResubmission`` — resubmit disagreed with committed
      result.
    - ``InvalidPrecondition`` — referenced entity not in required
      state.

    The Protocol does not cover constructor signatures: backends differ
    in their constructor (an in-memory store takes no URL; SQLite takes
    a path). Callers should treat construction as backend-specific.
